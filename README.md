# Journey Observation Tool

A Next.js TypeScript prototype application.

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Project Structure

- `app/` - Next.js App Router pages and layouts
- `components/` - Reusable React components (create as needed)
- `config/` - Configuration files and dummy data
- `types/` - TypeScript type definitions (create as needed)
- `lib/` - Utility functions and helpers (create as needed)

## Development Notes

- This is a prototype with no backend initially
- Dummy data is stored in `config/dummyData.ts`
- Once the frontend vision is finalized, we'll build out the backend
